# Goals: A Simple Task Manager

This morning, I found myself feeling frustrated. I often jot down ideas I want to work on, but in various places. Consequently, I often forget where I've placed what I need when I need it. This led me to a question - how can I solve this in a simple way?

The solution I came up with was to develop a Python program that functions as a task manager app. Many of the ideas I have and wish to pursue occur when I'm at my desk. So, having a basic program on my computer seems like the perfect solution!

'goals.py' is the only file you need. To use it, simply follow these steps:
      
      update: try 'goals2.py', it displays with a more intuitive GUI compared to using the CLI.  
## Step 1: Download 'goals.py'

You can download the 'goals.py' file from the repository [here](https://github.com/SoManyDistractions/Goals/blob/main/goals.py). Save it in any location of your choice.

## Step 2: Run 'goals.py'
Python Installation: Ensure that Python is installed on your computer. You can check this by typing `python` or `python --version` in the terminal or command prompt. If Python is not installed, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

i) Terminal or Command Prompt: On a Mac, use the Terminal application, and on Windows, use the Command Prompt or PowerShell.

ii) Changing Directories: Use the cd command to navigate to the folder where the 'goals.py' file is stored.

    e.g. cd desktop

iii) Running the Python Script: Once you're in the correct folder containing the 'goals.py' file, type python goals.py in the terminal or command prompt and press Enter. This command executes the Python script.
All set - you can now begin logging your tasks!

`python3 goals.py`
