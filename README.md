# Goals: A Super Simple Task Manager (for CLI)

Goals is a very basic but effective task manager or to-do list app. I say that its simplicity is a feature and not a bug. 

## My Motivation

I was feeling frustrated this morning because I tend to write down ideas I want to work on, but in different places, which leads me to eventually forget where I left what I need when I need it. So, I thought to myself - what is a simple way I can solve this?

The answer I landed on was to write a Python program that functions as a task manager app. I figured that many of these ideas I have and would want to work on, occur to me when I am at my desk, so having a basic program on my computer would definitely work! 


## Getting Started with 'goals.py'

'goals.py' is the only file you require. So to use it, simply follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download 'goals.py'

You can download the 'goals.py' file from the repository by [clicking here](https://github.com/SoManyDistractions/Goals/blob/main/goals.py). You can save it in any location of your choice.

### Step 2: Run 'goals.py'

**Terminal or Command Prompt:** On Mac, you'll use the **Terminal** application, while on Windows, you'll use the **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.

**Changing Directories:** Use the 'cd' command to navigate to the folder where the 'goals.py' file is saved. 
> Make sure to provide the correct path to the folder containing the file.

**Running the Python Script:** Once you are in the correct folder containing the 'goals.py' file, type `python goals.py` in the terminal or command prompt and press Enter. This command executes the Python script.

*Python Installation:* Verify that Python is installed on your computer. You can check this by typing 'python' or 'python --version' in the terminal or command prompt. If Python is not installed, you can download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org).
